# Stockroom Products

This project is a simple JavaScript-based web application that displays product information from a dataset, calculating total costs including tax and shipping for different product categories.

## Overview

- Modular JavaScript functions, including currying for tax and cost calculations.
- Easily customizable for additional product categories, tax rates, and shipping values.
